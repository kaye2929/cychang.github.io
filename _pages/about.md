I am a PhD student in the [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), advised by [Pine Liu](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/liu/) and [Sean Qian](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/qian/). A short version of my resume could be found [here](https://milanlx.github.io/files/xuanli_job_Apr_2021.pdf) .

**Research Interest**
Generalizable Model Predictive Control; Spatial-temporal Modeling of Interdependent Urban Systems; Stochastic Control

My current research focuses on the automatic modeling of HVAC systems, and implementing generalizable Model Predictive Control policies that can be integrated with existing building control frameworks. Before coming to CMU, I obtained M.S. in Structural Engineering, and B.S in Civil Engineering, both from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), fortunated to have been supervised by [Jinping Ou](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/oujinping) and worked on [optimal sensor placement of deepwater risers](https://milanlx.github.io/files/Master%20Dissertation%20(original).pdf) ([slides](https://milanlx.github.io/files/mastet_thesis_short_version.pdf)). 

Besides research, I am fan of soccer and reading. My favourite teams are **<span style="color: red"> AC </span> Milan**
 and [Dalian Pro FC](http://www.dlpro.com.cn/), and favourite writers are *Milan Kundera* and *J. D. Salinger*.
