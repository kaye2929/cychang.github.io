I am a PhD student in the [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), advised by [Pine Liu](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/liu/) and [Sean Qian](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/qian/). 

**Research Interest**
Interpretable Model Predictive Control; Spatial-temporal modeling of interdependent urban systems. <\br>

My current research focuses on the automatic modeling of HVAC systems, and implementing interpretable Model Predictive Control policies that can be integrated with current building control framework. Before coming to CMU, I obtained M.S. in Structural Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), fortunate to have supervised by [Jinping Ou]ï¼ˆhttp://homepage.hit.edu.cn/oujinping) and worked on optimal sensor placement of deepwater risers.
