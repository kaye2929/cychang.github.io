* Using Multi-modal Transportation Data For Energy Prediction and Management in Buildings
  * **motivation**: Urban systems, including transporations and buildings are highly interrelated given the spatial-temporal flow of system users. The change of magnitude of occupancy in one system can be in proportion to the fluctuation in one another. In this project we aim at investigating the edge potential of predicting the energy profile of buildings, from the rich and fine-grained transportation data including realtime traffic flow intensity, and public transit status. The refined prediction would further facilitate energy-efficient demand-based building control. [link](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1637222)
